Today we are delving into an analysis of Halloween Candy data using
ggplot, dplyr, basic stats, correlation, and PCA

### Section 1: load in the data

Read in the data:

```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.txt"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

There are 85 different candy types in this dataset

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(candy$fruity)
sum(candy$fruity)
```

There are 38 fruity candy types in the dataset.

> Q2. how many chocolate candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$chocolate)
```

There are 37 chocolate candy types in the dataset.

### Section 2: what is your favorite candy?

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s
> winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Reese's pieces",]$winpercent
candy["Reese's pieces","winpercent"]
```

After looking at the list of candy in the dataset, Twix is my favorite
candy in the dataset and it has a winpercent value of 81.64291

We can also use the filter() and select() functions from dplyr

```{r}
#| message: false
library(dplyr)
candy |> 
  filter(rownames(candy) == "Twix") |> 
  select(winpercent)

candy |> 
  filter(rownames(candy) == "Twix") |> 
  select(winpercent,sugarpercent)

candy |> 
  filter(rownames(candy) == "Nerds") |> 
  select(winpercent,sugarpercent)

```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy['Kit Kat',]$winpercent
```

The winpercent for Kit Kat is 76.7686

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy['Tootsie Roll Snack Bars',]$winpercent
```

The winpercent for Tootsie Roll Snack Bars is 49.6535

A useful function for a quick look at a new dataset is found in the
skimr package.

```{r}
#library("skimr")
skimr::skim(candy)
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale
> to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The winpercent variable seems to be a different scale than the majority
of the other columns since it ranges from 0 to 100. Most columns are
either 0 or 1 values. The pricepercent and sugarpercent columns have
values ranging from 0 to 1. Because of this, we should scale the data
before analysis like PCA.

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the
> candy\$chocolate column?

They represent true (1) and false (0) values, so 1 means that the candy
contains chocolate and 0 means that the candy does not contain
chocolate.

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values use base R and ggplot

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy) + aes(x=winpercent) + geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill = "lightblue", color = "blue")
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No, the distribution is not symmetrical. The distribution of winpercent
values is slightly skewed to the right since it has a center towards the
lower winpercent values and it has a tail at the higher winpercent
values

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

The center of the distribution is below 50%

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit
> candy?

Step 1. find extract chocolate candy rows in the dataset Step 2. get
their winpercent values step 3. caculate their mean winpercent
step4/5/6. repeat for fruity candy step 7. compare mean chocolate
winpercent to mean fruity win percent

```{r}
#step 1
choc.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1
choc.candy <- candy[choc.inds,]

#step 2
choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent

#step 3
choc.mean <- mean(choc.win)

#steps4/5/6
fruity.inds <- candy$fruity == 1
fruity.candy <- candy[fruity.inds,]
fruity.win <- fruity.candy$winpercent
fruity.mean <- mean(fruity.win)

paste("chocolte: ", choc.mean)
paste("fruity: ", fruity.mean)




```

```{r}
chocolate_win_mean <- mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)])
fruity_win_mean <- mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)])

paste("Chocolate:", chocolate_win_mean)
paste("Fruity:", fruity_win_mean)
```

On average, chocolate candy has a higher win percentage than fruity
candy

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

Let's use

```{r}
chocolate_win <- candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)]
fruity_win <- candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)]

t.test(choc.win, fruity.win)
```

The difference between the win percentage for chocolate candy and fruity
candy is significant since the p value is less than 0.05 ( p-value =
2.871e-08)

### Section 3: overall candy rankings

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

I can use the output of order(winpercent) to re-arrange (or order) my
whole dataset by winpercent

```{r}
ord.inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[ord.inds,], n = 6)
```

```{r}
candy |>
  arrange(winpercent) |>
  head(5)
```

The 5 least liked candies in the dataset are: Nik L Nip, Boston Baked
Beans, Chiclets, Super Bubble, and Jawbusters (in order from least liked
to most liked)

I like using the dplyr version better since it is a little more
intuitive

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
candy |>
  arrange(-winpercent) |>
  head(5)
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent, decreasing = TRUE),], n = 5)
```

The top 5 most popular candies are Reese's Peanut Butter cup, Reese's
Miniatures, Twix, Kit Kat, and Snickers

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=12}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(x = winpercent, y = rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col() 

```

We can make the plot better by rearranging the y axis by winpercent so
that the highest scoring candy is at the top and the lowest scoreing
candy is at the bottom.

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars
> sorted by winpercent?

To fix the squished axis issue can change the code chunk itself or save
the plot as a png and define the height and weight

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=12}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(x = winpercent, y = reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col() +
  xlab("Winning Percent") +
  ylab("")
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(candy) +
  aes(x = winpercent, y = reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col() +
  xlab("Winning Percent") +
  ylab("")

ggsave("my_plot.png", height=12, width=5)
```

markdown syntax to insert an image:

![Caption can go here](my_plot.png)

add some color: color bars by chocolate or not

Can't color by fill=chocolate in aes because it makes it a scale

```{r, fid.width = 10, fig.height = 12}


ggplot(candy) +
  aes(x = winpercent, y = reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent), fill = chocolate) +
  geom_col() +
  xlab("Winning Percent") +
  ylab("")

```

I want to color chocolate and fruity color a specific color

To do this, we need to define our own color map

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=12}
my_cols <- rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[candy$chocolate == 1] <- "chocolate"
my_cols[candy$bar == 1] <- "brown"
my_cols[candy$fruity == 1] <- "pink"


ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) +
  xlab("Winning Percent") +
  ylab("")

```

```{r}
ggsave("my_color_plot.png", height = 12, width = 6)

```

![](my_color_plot.png)

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets are the worst ranked chocolate candy

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst is the best ranked fruity candy

### Section 4: taking a look at pricepoint

Plot of winpercent vs pricepercent

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=12}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(x= winpercent, y = pricepercent, label = rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(color = my_cols) + 
  theme_bw() +
  geom_text(col = my_cols)
```

Can use ggrepel to avoid label or text overplotting

We can control the amount of labels visible setting different
max.overlaps values

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=12}
library(ggrepel)

#change the pink to red for fruity candy
my_cols[candy$fruity == 1] = "red"

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(x= winpercent, y = pricepercent, label = rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(color = my_cols) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 5)
```

> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for
> the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reese's miniatures is a good option that has high winpercent for a lower
pricepercent

> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and
> of these which is the least popular?

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE),c("pricepercent", "winpercent")], n=5)
```

The top five most expensive candies are Nik L Nip, Nestle Smarties, Ring
pop, Hershey's Krackel, and Hershey's milk chocolate. Of these,
Hershey's Krackel has the highest winpercent so it is the most popular

> Q21. Make a barplot again with geom_col() this time using pricepercent
> and then improve this step by step, first ordering the x-axis by value
> and finally making a so called “dot chat” or “lollipop” chart by
> swapping geom_col() for geom_point() + geom_segment().

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=12}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(pricepercent, reorder(rownames(candy), pricepercent)) +
  geom_segment(aes(yend = reorder(rownames(candy), pricepercent), 
                   xend = 0), col="gray40") +
    geom_point()
```

### Section 5: exploring the correlation structure

```{r}
library(corrplot)
cij <- cor(candy)
head(cij)
```

```{r}
corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e.
> have minus values)?

Fruity and chocolate are the most anti-correlated Pluribus and bar are
also anti-correlated

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Winpercent and chocolate are the most positively correlated bar is also
highly positively correlated with chocolate candy

```{r}
cij
```

### Section 6: Principal component analysis (PCA)

we can use prcomp and set scale = True since one of the variables is on
a different scale than other variables

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale = TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

Let's make our main results figures, first our score plot (PC plot)

```{r}
ggplot(pca$x) + aes(x=PC1, y = PC2, label=rownames(candy)) + geom_point(color = my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 5)
```

Fruity and chocolate tend to cluster with each other

Let's look at how the original variables contribute to our new PCs. This
is often called the variable loadings/contributions

```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation) + 
  aes(x = PC1, y = reorder(rownames(pca$rotation), PC1)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation) + 
  aes(x = PC2, y = reorder(rownames(pca$rotation), PC2)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the
> positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Fruity, hard, and pluribus are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive
direction. This makes sense because most pluribus candies are fruity and
hard, so it checks out that these variable are picked up together. We
also saw that these three variables were positively correlated in the
correlation matrix.
